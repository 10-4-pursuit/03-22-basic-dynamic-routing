## Objective
Learn how to create a dynamic route in a React application using React Router v6. Implement a route that changes its content based on URL parameters.

## Setup

1. **Create an 'Exercises' Directory** (If not already done):
   - If you haven't already, create a main directory on your local machine to house all your exercises. You can do this using `mkdir Exercises`.

2. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository for this exercise at `03-22-basic-dynamic-routing`.
   - Click on the 'Fork' button to create a fork of the repository.

3. **Clone Your Forked Repository**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to your `Exercises` directory using `cd path/to/Exercises`.
   - Run `git clone <your-forked-repo-url>` to clone the repository to your machine.
   - This will create a new directory named `03-22-basic-dynamic-routing` under `Exercises`.

4. **Initial Setup**:
   - The repository already includes the skeleton code generated by Create React App.
   - Navigate to the exercise directory: `cd 03-22-basic-dynamic-routing`.
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
   - Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Exercise Instructions

1. **Implement a Dynamic Route**:
   - In the `App` component, include a dynamic route using React Router. The route should be in the format `/user/:username`.
   - Create a new component named `UserProfile` within your application. This component should display a greeting message that incorporates the username from the URL. For example, navigating to `/user/john` should display "Hello, John!" on the page.

2. **Add Links for Testing the Dynamic Route**:
   - Within your application, preferably on the main page, add several `Link` components from `react-router-dom`.
   - These links should navigate to different user profiles. For example, add a link that navigates to `/user/mick`. When clicked, this link should lead to a page displaying "Hello, Mick!".
   - Include at least three different links, each pointing to a different username in the URL. Example usernames could be `mick`, `alice`, and `steve`. Ensure each link correctly routes to the `UserProfile` component and displays the appropriate greeting.

3. **Test the Dynamic Routing**:
   - After implementing the `UserProfile` component and adding the links, test your application.
   - Click on each link to ensure that the application routes correctly and that the `UserProfile` component displays the correct username based on the URL.

## Submission

1. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - After completing the exercise, ensure all your changes are saved.
   - Run `git add .` to stage your changes.
   - Run `git commit -m "Completed Basic Dynamic Routing exercise"` to commit your changes.

2. **Push to Your Fork**:
   - Run `git push` to push your commits to your forked repository on GitHub.

3. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on 'Pull Request' to create a new pull request to the original repository.
   - Ensure the pull request details are filled out, explaining the changes you made.
